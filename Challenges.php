            <h2>CHALLENGES IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN INDIA</h2>
            <h3>There are several challenges facing Indian higher education institutions, including funding, Quality,
                Access to education, faculty shortage, to name a few. Let us understand more of it.</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Funding:</span> Many Indian universities and colleges suffer from a
                    lack of funding, which can
                    impact their ability to attract and retain qualified faculty, provide adequate infrastructure, and
                    conduct research.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Quality of education:</span> Despite having some prestigious
                    institutions, there is a concern
                    over the quality of education offered in many Indian universities and colleges, leading to concerns
                    over employability of graduates.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Access to education:</span> Although India has made significant
                    progress in increasing
                    enrollment in higher education, there is still a significant gap in access to higher education for
                    marginalized and disadvantaged communities.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Outdated curriculum:</span> Some Indian higher education
                    institutions
                    still rely on outdated
                    curricula that do not adequately prepare students for modern workplaces or address emerging trends.
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Faculty shortage:</span> There is a shortage of qualified faculty in
                    many Indian higher
                    education institutions, which can impact the quality of education and research.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Infrastructure:</span> Many Indian universities and colleges lack
                    basic infrastructure such as
                    libraries, laboratories, and research facilities.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Governance:</span> There are concerns over governance and autonomy
                    in
                    higher education
                    institutions, with some institutions facing political interference, leading to administrative and
                    academic inefficiencies.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Addressing these challenges will require significant efforts from both the government and higher
                education institutions in India. It will require increasing funding, improving the quality of education
                and curriculum, enhancing access to education, increasing faculty numbers, improving infrastructure, and
                ensuring good governance and autonomy in higher education institutions.</h3>
